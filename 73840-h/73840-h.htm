  <h2 class='c005'>The House the Children Built</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>Once upon a time there lived a good and beautiful
Fairy named Health, and she was very happy, for
all around were flowers and trees and birds and in
the midst of these, her house.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now Health’s house was built of bricks and shingles and
lovely colored glass. One day when the sky was blue and
the sun shining, down the road came an ugly old Witch. Her
face was hard and her eyes were very cruel. She stopped
in front of Health’s lovely garden and from her pocket
drew forth a yellow ball and threw it with all her strength
toward the house.</p>

<p class='c007'>It settled on the roof, and where it fell there sprang
forth fire, which spread and spread over the house, until it
was a mass of flames. Fairy Health ran to the well for
water, but before her tiny hands could draw the water up
from the well, her house was burnt beyond all help.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the Witch, whose name was Ignorance, saw the
harm she had done, she laughed a cruel laugh and hobbled
down the road.</p>

<p class='c007'>Poor little Fairy Health sank upon the grass in her garden
and cried. At last she was conscious of a voice and looking
up, saw in a green bush quite near a lovely Bird, who said:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>“Keep up your courage, Fairy, for I will tell you how to
build your house anew.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Health dried her eyes upon a sweet geranium leaf, and
asked him how that could possibly be done.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Bird replied: “It can be done by the hands of Children
alone. Every time a Child learns to eat the right food,
a brick shall be added to your house, every time a Child
learns to sleep in the sweet fresh air, a shingle shall be put
upon the roof. And every time a Child learns to play and
be happy, a colored glass shall be added to the windows.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But alas!” said Fairy Health, “How shall we teach the
Children these things?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I will go to the Teachers who are wise and good,” said
the Bird, “and tell them what to do.”</p>

<p class='c007'>So the Bird, whose name was Education, started on his
journey. He took his brother Rumor with him to help tell
the Teachers, because there were a great many Teachers to
be told about the Children’s health.</p>

<p class='c007'>Far and near these wise birds traveled, to little towns
and to big cities, and everywhere the Teachers listened to
their story, until in all that great country, the Children were
taught to eat wholesome food, to sleep in the sweet fresh air,
and to play and be happy.</p>

<p class='c007'>And as the Children grew healthy and happy, the bricks
were added to the Fairy’s house, and shingles were put
upon the roof. Lovely colored glass filled up the broken
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>windows, and once again there stood among the trees and
flowers a house so beautiful that strangers, passing by,
paused to admire it. Health often invited them to rest in
her garden, and as she refreshed them with sparkling water
from the well, she told the story of her house, and how
Children had rebuilt it for her.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>The Magic Oat Field</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>One day as the Fairy Health sat within her Rose
Arbor, there came walking down the road a tiny
Elf. He had a merry face and a bright smile, and
pausing beside the Garden Gate, he asked:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Does Health live here?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am Health,” said the Fairy, and rose to greet him.
The Elf drew from his pocket a little card, on which was
written “Cho-Cho, the Friend of Children,” and presented
it to the Fairy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I come,” he said, “to view the wonders of your Garden,
and to learn from you the secrets of a Child’s Heart.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The good Fairy took Cho-Cho’s hand and leading him by
many lovely paths, came at length into a Field of ripening
Oats. On the borders of the Field grew flowers of many
colors, and the air was filled with perfume.</p>

<p class='c007'>Health paused and said: “As long as these beautiful
Oats flourish I know that everywhere in all this great country
Children can eat Oatmeal for their breakfast and grow
strong and healthy, but if the Oats should wither and die,
something dreadful would happen to the Children.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Even as she spoke, a strange light settled on the Oat
Field, and the beautiful waving grain began to shrivel and
wither away.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>A look of terror came into the Fairy’s eyes. As Cho-Cho
turned to clasp her hand in sympathy, suddenly there stood
beside him a handsome Persian Cat.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Don’t lose heart, little Fairy,” said Puss, “I will help
you. Last night, as I was walking in the moonlight, I saw
an ugly old Witch creep into your garden.</p>

<p class='c007'>“In her hand she carried a large strong box. I hid behind
a bush and saw her open the box. As she raised the lid, out
sprang swarms of tiny insects and flew toward the Oat
Field. The Witch laughed a harsh laugh, and said, ‘Go,
little imps—work quickly, for your time is short.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“I understand magic, Fairy, and can change at will into
any shape that pleases me—so in the twinkling of an eye I
became a Witch too, and walking slowly forward, I said,
‘A fine night, Madam Witch. What do you here?’</p>

<p class='c007'>“The old Witch jumped when she heard my voice, but
seeing it was only a Witch like herself, she grinned horribly
and said: ‘I have persuaded hundreds of children to stop
eating Oatmeal, and every time a Child refuses Oatmeal,
one of these little imps is born. Before tomorrow night the
Fairy’s Oat Field will be withered and dead. One thing
only can stop these imps of mine,’ she chuckled.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘What is that, O powerful Witch?’ I asked.</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘I must be bound fast with chains of steel. If such a
thing could happen my imps would quickly die and the
Children would eat Oatmeal again and the Field regain its
beauty, but ha! ha! no one can bind me.’</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>“‘You must be very clever, Madam Witch,’ I said, ‘But
it grows late and I must away.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“So I left her there and went to my home.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What shall I do?” the little Fairy cried. “What shall
I do?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Be not discouraged, Fairy,” said the Persian Cat, “I
am your friend, follow me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Down the road the cat led them for fully half a mile,
until they came to a forest of fir trees. Quiet reigned within
the wood. It was so very still that even their soft footsteps
on the pine needles could be heard. There was no
light except from far above their heads, where the blue sky
shone through the green branches of the trees.</p>

<p class='c007'>Puss went on and on, until Cho-Cho and the Fairy were
growing quite tired. At last he stopped before a huge tree
whose branches touched the ground. Parting these, the Cat
entered, and followed by his two friends, stood beside the
Tree.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Wonderful, Wonderful, Wonderful Tree,</div>
      <div class='line'>Open, Oh open your door unto me!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Slowly the trunk of the great Tree opened and they beheld
a narrow stairway leading down, down, farther than their
eyes could see.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Come,” said the Cat, “the Witch lives here. Step
lightly or we may rouse her.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>Softly, very softly, they crept down those narrow steps,
until at last they entered a dark room. Its only light came
from a fire of coals, and before this fire the Witch lay sleeping.
Springing upon her, Puss bound her arms and feet with
chains of steel, and she lay helpless before them, uttering
cries of hate and wickedness.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Wonderful Cat, who are you?” said Cho-Cho.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am Knowledge,” said the Cat, “and this cruel Witch
is Ignorance, who spends her life plotting against the health
of Children. Between us there is always war. Lie there,
Ignorance, while the Children you wish to kill grow strong
and healthy. Fairy, your Oat Field is beautiful again.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Leaving the dark home of Ignorance, they traveled
through the sweet scented forest, back to the garden of the
Fairy Health. There they found that the Cat had told them
true, for the Oat Field was beautiful beyond words. The
blue sky smiled above, and the summer wind blew over it,
carrying the perfume of a thousand flowers, and all the
world seemed full of peace.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Cat, dear Cat, what can we do for you?” said Cho-Cho.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Only this,” said Puss, “help me to fight Ignorance.”</p>

<p class='c007'>From his finger the Cat took two tiny rings. One he
gave to Cho-Cho and one to the Fairy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If ever again this cruel Witch arises to destroy the
Children’s Oatmeal, turn this ring upon your finger twice
and say:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>“Knowledge, Knowledge,</div>
      <div class='line'>Wherever you be,</div>
      <div class='line'>Come, Oh, come,</div>
      <div class='line'>The Children need Thee!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>And as he said this, Puss waved a gay “Good-bye” and
walked gracefully away.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>The Wonderful Window</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>Cho-Cho, a tiny Elf, built his house upon the roof
of a tall office building in a great city. He chose a
sunny corner of the chimney, and there with sticks
and strings, brought to him by his friends, the Sparrows, he
erected a cozy little Home.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the outside, it was quite pretty, but after you entered
the door and saw the fire on the hearth, and Cho-Cho’s armchair
and books beside it, you decided that it was the most
charming little house in all that noisy city.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now within this house was a Magic Window, and from
this window Cho-Cho could look into all the homes where
Children lived.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sitting beside the Magic Window one day, Cho-Cho
beheld a sight that filled his heart with pity. In a dingy
room he saw a thin, pale little Boy, sitting beside a rough
table, on which the only food was some cheap buns and
coffee. As Cho-Cho looked, he saw the Child try to raise
the heavy cup to his lips, but his little hands were far too
weak, and it fell with a crash upon the floor, breaking into
many pieces, and spilling the coffee. Now this Child loved
coffee, because all his life he had been used to drinking it.
As he saw the coffee wasted on the floor, he laid his head
upon the table and cried and cried and cried. Presently he
fell asleep.</p>

<p class='c007'>As he slept, Cho-Cho stood beside him, and taking his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>hand, led him far, far away from the great city and all its
noise and danger. When the little Boy woke, he was walking
down a quiet country road and Cho-Cho was with him.
Wild grass and violets grew along this road, and far away
on either side stretched fields of lovely clover, whose pink
blossoms swayed in the wind.</p>

<p class='c007'>Passing through a gateway, they entered the field. And
now they saw an old farm house surrounded by trees. In
the door stood a Sweet-faced Woman, who looked at them
with kindly interest.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Lady,” said Cho-Cho, “this little Boy has no Mother.
Will you give him a glass of your good milk? He is very
faint.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Then a strange thing happened. Cho-Cho vanished.
He had been standing right beside the little Boy and then
suddenly he was gone.</p>

<p class='c007'>The little Boy began to cry, and the Farmer’s Wife, whose
heart was full of love for children, and who had none of
her own, gathered him up in her strong arms, and carried
him into the large kitchen.</p>

<p class='c007'>Here she gave him fresh Brown Bread to eat and Milk
that was sweet and cool, and he ate and ate, until he could
eat no more.</p>

<p class='c007'>As the days went by, the good Woman learned to love the
little Boy as if he were her own, and he grew so strong and
healthy that no one would have imagined him the same
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>lonely Child that Cho-Cho had brought to the Farm House.
All day long he played in the sweet clover-scented air, sometimes
with the little calves in the field, but more often beside
the Dairy, where the Sweet-faced Woman spent so much of
her time.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Dairy was built of stone, and the walls were thick
and deep. A little stream ran through it, and in a stone
trough stood great crocks of Milk, Milk to make Children
strong and healthy, for nothing in all the world is so good
for Children as Milk. The stream sang among the Milk
crocks, and the little Boy played beside the Dairy, and the
good Woman smiled and was happy.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then, one day while the little Boy was playing in the
clover field, down the road came an old Witch. She smiled
at the Child, and spoke pleasantly to him, but in her heart
was hate and ugliness.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Come walk with me, my dear,” she said, “and I will give
you coffee to drink.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The Farmer’s Wife had often told the little Boy never to
drink coffee for it was very bad for Children, but he liked
coffee, so he took the old Witch’s hand and followed her far,
far away.</p>

<p class='c007'>As the sunlight faded from the fields, and night came
on, the Sweet-faced Woman missed the little Boy, and anxiously
looked for him, but nowhere could he be found.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now Cho-Cho from his Magic Window in the great city
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>had never ceased to look each day toward the country and
the Farm where the Boy lived, and as he saw the Child
grow strong and healthy, he smiled with pleasure, for Cho-Cho
was the Friend of Children.</p>

<p class='c007'>But today as he looked, to his great surprise, he saw the
Sweet-faced Woman sobbing on her doorstep, and he knew
that something must be wrong. After putting out the
living-room fire and locking the door of his house, Cho-Cho
started at once for the Farm. The Woman still sat on her
doorstep, sad with weeping.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Lady,” said Cho-Cho, “tell me your trouble.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Then she told him that the little Boy was lost.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I will find him,” said Cho-Cho, “for I have in my pocket
a Magic Magnet, and when I hold it in my right hand, it
will draw me toward anyone whom I wish to seek. Have
courage, I will bring back your little Boy.”</p>

<p class='c007'>As he spoke, Cho-Cho drew out the Magic Magnet and
held it in his right hand. Slowly the Magnet turned toward
the sunny road, and Cho-Cho walked on.</p>

<p class='c007'>The path was very rough and full of sharp stones, and
ended at last in front of an enormous rock. In this rock
was an iron door, so stout and heavy that it could not be
opened, unless one had the key, and Cho-Cho had no key.</p>

<p class='c007'>As Cho-Cho rested for a bit, feeling rather discouraged,
he heard a voice, and there sat a Red Brown Squirrel.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>“What is wrong, Friend?” said the Squirrel.</p>

<p class='c007'>“A little Boy is lost,” said Cho-Cho, “and I know that
he is behind this wall, but I cannot open the door.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I can help you,” said the Squirrel. Stooping, he picked
up a small stone, and began to rub it between his paws. As
he rubbed, the stone turned to iron, and quickly into a key
that fitted the lock on the huge door.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I thank you,” said Cho-Cho. “What is your name?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am Friendship,” said the Squirrel, “and I will go with
you on your journey.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Through the great door they went, and on again up the
mountain, coming at last to the top, and there on the ground
lay the little Boy. His clothes were soiled, and torn in many
places, for the Witch had dragged him up the mountainside
by one small arm, and the rough stones and briars had
caught his garments as she hurried him onward. He was
asleep where the Witch had thrown him. Cho-Cho’s heart
filled with pity when he saw the little figure lying there.
Bending over, Cho-Cho gently touched the tear-stained face
and the little Boy awoke.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Where is the Witch?” Cho-Cho asked. The little Boy
caught his hand in a frightened grasp. He was so afraid
that he could scarcely speak.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Cho-Cho, take me home,” he sobbed, “take me home,
before the Witch comes back.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>“She shall not hurt you,” Cho-Cho answered. “But
where did she go?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Before the Child could speak, a harsh laugh sounded in
their ears, a heavy stone whistled through the air, and fell
beside Cho-Cho, barely missing his head, then all was very
still.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Stay with the Boy,” Cho-Cho told the friendly Squirrel,
“this Witch shall be punished.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The Magnet in his hand pointed directly toward a large
rock. Its steep sides were very sharp and rough, and looking
up Cho-Cho saw the ugly Witch standing on the top.</p>

<p class='c007'>“So I am to be punished, am I?” she screamed, her face
distorted by rage, “I will show you who has power here,”
and she hurled a sharp stone at Cho-Cho. Springing aside,
Cho-Cho drew an arrow from its quiver and a stout bow
from his back, and carefully aiming, he pulled the bow
string. The arrow sped through the air, and struck the
Witch with such force that she fell forward, and losing her
balance, rolled over and over down the side of the great rock.
When Cho-Cho reached the place where she lay unconscious,
one arm hung limp at her side, broken by the fall. Her feet
were scarred by heavy chains that had once bound her, and
looking on her cruel face Cho-Cho said, “She has been punished
enough.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Then taking the little Boy’s hand, Cho-Cho started back
to the Farm House. The Sweet-faced Woman met them on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>the road and when she saw the little Boy, her face lit up with
happiness and love.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What can I do for you, Cho-Cho?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Help little Children,” Cho-Cho answered, and looking at
his wrist watch, he saw it was quite late, and remembering a
business engagement in the city, he hurried away.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>The Little Vegetable Men</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>One sunny summer day, the little Fairy Health
worked among her flowers, weeding and digging
the rich brown earth to make them beautiful. She
sang, as she worked, a gay little song, and tripped lightly
here and there over the grass and flower beds. Stopping at
last to wipe the earth from her hands upon a large lily
leaf, for it made a most convenient towel, she looked up
and saw Cho-Cho coming down the road and ran to the
gate to greet him.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now Cho-Cho was a tiny Elf who loved Children, and
he was one of the Fairy’s oldest friends.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Fairy,” said Cho-Cho, “in looking from my Magic
Window last evening I saw the old Witch Ignorance abroad.
Up and down the city streets she went and into all the homes
where Children live, and on the door of every house she
made a black mark.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, Cho-Cho,” said the Fairy, “this means trouble for
the Children.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes,” said Cho-Cho.</p>

<p class='c007'>Leading him to a seat within her Rose Arbor, the Fairy
brought him sparkling water from her well and bade him
rest until he felt refreshed.</p>

<p class='c007'>As she spoke, through the garden gate came three queer-looking
little Men. The first had the head of a Beet, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>his clothes were made from dull green leaves. His shoes and
stockings were beet-colored and in his hand he carried
a green hat.</p>

<p class='c007'>The second little Man was a white Onion, and his clothes
were the green of onion tops; and the third little fellow had
the face of a Carrot, and he, too, was all in green.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Fairy,” said the little Man who looked like a Beet, “we
are in great trouble and have come to ask for your help. We
are called the Green Vegetables and are a large and happy
family. Last night while we slept, the wicked Witch Ignorance
crept in among us and carried off one of our little Men.
We did not know that he was gone until we were awakened
by his cries, and when we rushed to help him, this cruel
Witch beat us to the ground and sped far away.</p>

<p class='c007'>“This morning, I found upon my doorstep a letter. It
was from the Witch and said that unless we gave her gold
she would return each night and carry away one of our
comrades. Help us, Fairy, for this Witch is very powerful.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Courage, little Man,” said the Fairy, “Cho-Cho and
I will help you.” “Fairy,” said Cho-Cho, “I must find this
cruel Witch, for if she hurts these little Men, the Children
will have no Vegetables to eat, and Children must eat Vegetables.
This is what the black mark meant upon the doors,”
and turning, Cho-Cho walked rapidly away.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now Cho-Cho had a friend, a Wonderful Dog, who
could travel like the wind, and he hurried down the road
toward the Dog’s house.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>Finding the Dog at home, Cho-Cho told him of the
little Men, and added, “I must find this Witch before nightfall,
and it is now noon. I cannot travel fast enough, for she
lives far away. Will you take me on your back?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“With pleasure,” said the Dog, “but I do not know the
way.” Leaning forward, Cho-Cho slowly passed his hands
before the Dog’s eyes. Immediately sight was given to the
Dog and he could see far off in the distance the Witch’s
house and the road that led to it.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hurry,” said Cho-Cho, seating himself upon the Dog’s
back, “it grows late.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The great Dog started forward and at each step his pace
quickened until his feet scarcely seemed to touch the
ground. Faster, faster, and faster he went, and the wind
whistled through his long hair, and his beautiful tail waved
like a plume. Trees and houses flew by them as they rushed
on, and the Dog laughed with glee.</p>

<p class='c007'>Cho-Cho, clinging on with hands and feet, saw ahead
of them a high stone fence. The Dog went over it in a flying
leap and landed safely on the other side in a field of grass.
Here he began to slacken his pace, for in front of them
loomed a dark forest, and only a narrow pathway led
through it.</p>

<p class='c007'>Entering the forest, the Dog was obliged to walk, as the
path grew rough and steep, and the underbrush on either
side was thick and tangled. At last they came to the mouth
of a cave.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>“This is the home of the Witch,” said Cho-Cho. “We
will hide here in the bushes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Presently they heard a harsh laugh and the ugly Witch
came forth from the shadow of the cave. She paused a
moment, dazzled by the sunlight, and Cho-Cho could see
clearly the deep scars on her bare ankles, made by chains
that had once bound her, and her left arm hung in a sling.</p>

<p class='c007'>Drawing from his pocket a bright crystal ball, he flashed
it directly in the Witch’s eyes.</p>

<p class='c007'>She stood spellbound for several minutes holding one
hand to her head, then her body slowly relaxed and she
slipped down upon the pathway.</p>

<p class='c007'>Cho-Cho stepped forth from his hiding place among the
bushes, and stood beside the Witch.</p>

<p class='c007'>She lay quite still as though asleep. “Lie there for two
and twenty hours,” Cho-Cho said, “and when you awaken
your sight shall be so dimmed that never again shall you see
clearly—never again shall you molest the Green Vegetables.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Then they went forward into the cave to find the little
Vegetable Man. He lay upon the ground, bound hand and
foot, trembling with fear.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Courage, little Man,” said Cho-Cho, “we are your
friends and have come to take you home,” and cutting his
bonds, they led him forth from the cave.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Who are you, Friends?” said the little Man.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>“I am Cho-Cho, the Friend of the Children, and this Dog
is called Publicity,” said Cho-Cho. “We work together for
the Health of the Children.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Then mounting the Dog’s broad back, they started on
their homeward journey.</p>

<p class='c007'>That night from his Magic Window, Cho-Cho beheld a
strange sight, for in the fields and gardens the little Vegetable
Men were dancing in the Moonlight, and as they
danced, they sang with joy, for the old Witch Ignorance lay
helpless in the Forest and they were safe from harm.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>The Lovely Bird</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>One summer day when the city streets were full of
heat and dust, and all the world seemed tired, Cho-Cho’s
thoughts turned longingly to the country and
to the lovely Garden of the little Fairy Health.</p>

<p class='c007'>Packing his bag and locking the door of his house, Cho-Cho
started on a visit to the Fairy.</p>

<p class='c007'>Within the Fairy’s Garden, screened from the road by
trees and bushes, was a lovely dell, and in the center of the
dell a Fountain, so beautiful that all who saw it paused to
admire its sparkling waters and the beauty of its sculptured
figure. This figure was of white marble, carved with rare
skill into the form of a little child, and from its uplifted
hand the waters of the fountain sprang.</p>

<p class='c007'>Cho-Cho found the Fairy resting in the cool shade and
sank into a seat beside her.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Fairy,” said Cho-Cho, “I am grieved about my Children.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What is wrong, Cho-Cho?” said the little Fairy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There are two Imps,” said Cho-Cho, “going into all the
houses where children live. One is called Dirt, and he
leaves upon the Children’s hands and faces and in their hair
and on their clothes ugly black marks. The other Imp is
called Neglect, and he whispers to the Children not to clean
their teeth, or brush their hair, or bathe their bodies. I saw
these Imps from my Magic Window, Fairy, and I came to
ask your help. What shall we do?”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>“I have a strong friend,” said the Fairy, “a Lovely Bird,
called Education, and he will go to the Teachers, and they
will teach the Children how to be cleanly, and to love the
cool pure water.”</p>

<p class='c007'>As she spoke, they heard a noise of wings, and the Lovely
Bird fluttered to the ground. Then the Fairy told him of
their trouble.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Courage,” said the Bird, “I will go to the Teachers, but
my way will be full of peril, for these Imps are powerful and
they will try to hold me back. Each day you must watch
within this dell. If I am hurt, you will find beside the
fountain a Blue-Gray Feather. Then, Cho-Cho, you must
hasten to my aid.”</p>

<p class='c007'>As he said this, the Lovely Bird rose into the air, and
mounted higher and higher, until he was lost to their view.
Day after day Cho-Cho and the Fairy sat beside the fountain
watching for the Feather, and after many days had
passed, they began to hope that Education had safely
reached the Teachers.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then one day, slowly circling downward from the sky,
came a Blue-Gray Feather, and rested at their feet.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, Cho-Cho,” said the Fairy, “the Lovely Bird is
hurt,” and laying her head upon the fountain’s edge, she
sobbed with grief and disappointment.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Courage,” said Cho-Cho, “I have a noble ally, a Wonderful
Dog, who can travel like the wind. His name is
Publicity, and he will help Education. His home is not far
distant. Be brave. The Lovely Bird shall soon be free.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Then Cho-Cho hastened to the home of the Dog. Arriving
there, he rapped smartly on the door, which was opened
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>by the Dog’s wife, who said he was just finishing his breakfast—that
he would be out immediately.</p>

<p class='c007'>In a few minutes the Dog appeared. Then Cho-Cho told
him of the Lovely Bird.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I shall be glad to help,” said the Wonderful Dog, “but
how shall I find the way?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Taking from his pocket the Blue-Gray Feather, Cho-Cho
held it before the Dog’s nose. He sniffed it eagerly and
then throwing up his head, laughed with glee. “Get up
quickly, Cho-Cho,” he said, and Cho-Cho sprang upon
his back.</p>

<p class='c007'>The great Dog bounded through the door and out into
the road, and with a sharp bark was off like wind.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Children scurried from the roadside, and people
standing in their doorways gazed with wonder as the Dog
rushed by. Through villages and towns he went, and everywhere
the people ran out to see Publicity pass.</p>

<p class='c007'>They left the houses far behind, and still the great Dog
did not slacken his pace, until they came to desolate fields
and a countryside where no trees grew.</p>

<p class='c007'>On all sides stretched these lonely fields, with no signs
of life, except where far away to the right rose the dark
outline of a house. A rough path led toward it, and following
this road the Dog went forward. As they drew
nearer they could see the house was of stone, and had no
windows on the lower floor. Up near the roof were narrow
windows set deep in the wall. Only a great door in the front,
made of iron, gave entrance to the house, and this was tightly
locked.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>Sitting on the ground, the Dog took from his neck a
stout collar made of heavy leather and brass, and opening
a pocket on the inside of this collar, he took out a Golden
Key.</p>

<p class='c007'>This key fitted the lock, and entering a large room they
found the Imps asleep before a fire. As the great door
creaked upon its rusty hinges the Imps awakened and
sprang to their feet.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What have you done with the Lovely Bird?” Cho-Cho
demanded. “I have seen no bird,” said the Imp called Dirt.
“You may search this house from dark cellar to dusty
garret if you doubt my word.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Cho-Cho turned to his friend the Dog. “Watch here,”
he said, “and see to it that these Imps do not escape.” Then
holding his Magic Magnet in his hand he looked about the
room. The Magnet turned toward the door at the far corner,
and Cho-Cho following the Magnet entered a dark and
narrow passage, that seemed to lead on and on. He could
not see, but Cho-Cho’s stout heart knew no fear for he
possessed magic power, that protected him from all evil—so
he called to his friend the Moon and asked for help.
Mr. Moon had not yet risen, but he sent for his chief Clerk
and gave an order, “Send down to my friend Cho-Cho one
of our latest flashlights,” he said, “one of Golden Light,
that will turn the darkest dungeon into the light of day.”</p>

<p class='c007'>So in the shortest possible time Cho-Cho held in his
hand a powerful flashlight that showed him every corner
of the dark passage, but no matter how carefully he looked
he could find no trace of the Lovely Bird.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>Standing there thinking, he heard a faint sound that
seemed to come from within the wall, and looking at his
Magnet found that it pointed directly opposite.</p>

<p class='c007'>With his ear at the wall, he heard the sound clearer—then
suddenly his eye caught the glint of steel, and he saw a small
bright spot about the size of a pea. Cho-Cho pressed the
spot and the wall opened showing a tiny room. The Lovely
Bird lay on the floor, too weak to fly—so Cho-Cho carried
him forth and helped him on the Dog’s back.</p>

<p class='c007'>The wicked Imps knew that their punishment was near
and cowered in the corner.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then Cho-Cho bound the two Imps with strong cords.
Standing them back to back he tied their arms together
and also their legs, so that they could go neither forward
nor backward, and mounting the back of his friend the
Wonderful Dog, he started homeward.</p>

<p class='c007'>They could hear the cries of the Imps far down the roadway,
for each one blamed the other with ugly words for
what had happened.</p>

<p class='c007'>When Education felt stronger he flew forward with his
Message to the Teachers.</p>

<p class='c007'>And everywhere the Teachers received him with the
deepest interest, and now all over this great country Children
are being taught the beauty of cleanliness and the
love of fresh air and pure water.</p>

<p class='c007'>As the Children learn these wholesome health habits, they
in turn teach others, and in every home tooth brushes and
soap and pure water are to be found, and busy mothers go
about their work with cheerful faces, for their Children
are healthy and clean and happy.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>The Fairy’s Party</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>Neighbors passing the house of the little Fairy
Health, one lovely summer day, noticed a most unusual
stir and bustle. Large and small packages
were continually arriving and the neat little housemaid was
kept quite busy opening and closing the door to receive
them.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Fairy, flitting here and there among the flower beds,
was accosted by one curious neighbor and asked what it
all meant.</p>

<p class='c007'>With her hands full of flowers the Fairy paused to answer
him:</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am giving a party this afternoon,” she said, “to friends
from a distance, and we are all very busy.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Cho-Cho, arriving about this time, was told to leave his
bag in the house and hurry back to help gather roses.</p>

<p class='c007'>The curious neighbor departed, and Cho-Cho and the
Fairy worked for an hour, gathering flowers and vines, to
make the beautiful house more beautiful.</p>

<p class='c007'>At last it was all finished, and the Fairy hurried upstairs
to don her party gown before the guests should arrive.</p>

<p class='c007'>When she came down the stairs a half hour later, Cho-Cho,
waiting in the hallway, held his breath in admiration,
for the little Fairy was so lovely that words can scarce describe
her. Her gown fell in graceful lines about her slender
figure—neck and arms were bare, and her flower-like face
crowned with its shining hair was radiant with joy. Forget-me-nots
were twined among her curls, and she carried a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>bunch of them in her shapely hands. No jewels adorned the
Fairy, but in every way she expressed simplicity and grace.</p>

<p class='c007'>Cho-Cho, coming forward, dropped lightly on one knee,
and taking the Fairy’s hand, raised it to his lips.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You are wonderful,” he said.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You like my gown, Cho-Cho?” she questioned, and
smiled upon him, for these two were old and tried friends.</p>

<p class='c007'>A noise from without told of the advent of a guest, and
Health went forward to greet the visitor.</p>

<p class='c007'>It proved to be the Persian Cat, looking quite handsome
in a soft-gray hat, which he gracefully doffed to the Fairy,
and he carried a gold-headed cane.</p>

<p class='c007'>One could well imagine him a great favorite with the
ladies, for he was indeed a finished dandy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You rival your flowers in beauty, Fairy,” he said, as he
took her hand.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the noise of the garden gate closing, they looked up
to behold the Wonderful Dog and his wife coming toward
them.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Wonderful Dog had on a smart new collar, and came
forward with dignity to present his wife to the Fairy, for
they had never met.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mrs. Dog was a fluffy little thing, who seemed really to
care more about her new dress and the latest style than
any other subject.</p>

<p class='c007'>The next arrival was the little Boy from the Farm. He
came timidly toward the group, looking rather frightened,
but when he spied his old friend, Cho-Cho, all his fears
vanished and he smiled with pleasure.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>They were busily chatting in the Rose Arbor, when the
little Vegetable Men came softly in and stood beside the
Fairy.</p>

<p class='c007'>She welcomed them with kindness, for these were modest
little people and felt rather strange among the handsome
company.</p>

<p class='c007'>With a whirr of wings and a flash of color, the Lovely Bird
and his brother Rumor were among them and congratulated
the Fairy on the perfect weather she was having for her
Fête.</p>

<p class='c007'>The company were all assembled now except the Red
Brown Squirrel, and the Fairy asked if anyone had seen
him on the high-road as they came hither. But no one had
heard of him, although the Persian Cat had come from that
direction.</p>

<p class='c007'>An hour slipped by. The Fairy was growing anxious and
Cho-Cho repeatedly looked at his watch.</p>

<p class='c007'>At last he said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“With your permission, Fairy, I will go look for the Red
Brown Squirrel. He was my friend and I greatly fear some
evil has befallen him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I, too, will go,” said the Cat, “there are many dangers
upon the high-road, and a comrade may be needed.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am with you,” said the Dog. “Lead on, Cho-Cho.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Friends,” said the Persian Cat, “I believe I can find
the Red Brown Squirrel. Between his home and the Fairy’s
garden there lives an evil imp, called Jealousy. I passed
him today as I journeyed hither and he scowled upon me
with a look of rage. He was afraid to attack me, but the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>Squirrel is small and not a match for this cruel imp, and has
doubtless fallen a victim to his malice.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hasten, hasten,” said Cho-Cho, and passing through the
gate he started briskly toward the Squirrel’s home.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Cat and the Dog followed and all three were soon lost
to the view of the anxious company in the Fairy’s garden.</p>

<p class='c007'>The friends covered the ground rapidly and were nearing
the home of the Red Brown Squirrel, when Cho-Cho’s
sharp eyes spied a half-eaten nut lying in the roadway.</p>

<p class='c007'>There were no trees near, and they knew that it must have
been dropped by their friend.</p>

<p class='c007'>Looking eagerly upon the ground, they discovered the
tiny footprints of the Squirrel and the larger ones of the
flat-footed imp, leading into a field of tall grass.</p>

<p class='c007'>Here the Cat went forward, for his sharp eyes could
distinguish the footprints with great ease. Following these
signs they crossed the field and came out upon an unused
road that sloped downward, until they found themselves
beside a deep river which seemed impossible to pass.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Get upon my back,” said the Wonderful Dog, “the
River is my comrade, it will not harm you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>With ease and confidence he swam forward, and carried
them to safety on the further bank.</p>

<p class='c007'>Cho-Cho and the Persian Cat stepped from the Dog’s
back and turned to thank him, when from behind a large
rock, the ugly imp darted out and sprang toward Cho-Cho,
trying to push him into the river. But the Cat, catching
the imp by the neck, held him firmly, and he was powerless
to do aught but scream.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>Binding him fast they went behind the great rock and
found the Red Brown Squirrel in chains.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Cat set him free and the friendly Squirrel stood up
before them brave and unhurt.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then they hurried back to the Fairy and were received
with relief and pleasure.</p>

<p class='c007'>And now, the Fairy with the Wonderful Dog leads the
way to the dining-room. The Persian Cat gracefully offers
his arm to little Mrs. Dog. Cho-Cho and the Boy come
hand in hand, followed by the Lovely Bird and Mr. Beet.
The Red Brown Squirrel is telling the story of his adventure
to Mr. Onion, and Rumor and Mr. Carrot bring up
the rear.</p>

<p class='c007'>The dining-room is a mass of roses and smilax, and in
the center, a table full of all the delicious things that children
like.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mrs. Dog remarks that the decorations are lovely, and
the Persian Cat replies that the ladies are more beautiful
than the flowers.</p>

<p class='c007'>The little Fairy flits here and there among her guests,
seeing, with charming courtesy, that all their wants are well
supplied, and when at last they can eat no more, Cho-Cho
rises, and with a glass of sparkling lemonade proposes a
toast:</p>

<p class='c007'>“To our charming hostess, the Fairy Health.”</p>

<p class='c007'>With a right good will the company drink the toast, then
led by the Persian Cat they leave the house and with laughter
and jest pass by lovely garden paths out to the fountain—and
so the fun goes on, ending at last with a dance
in the dell, and joy and happiness in every heart.</p>
